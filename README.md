## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Contribution to Project Success:

Effective cost control is essential for keeping a software project financially sustainable and successful. It maximizes return on investment (ROI) by ensuring resources are used efficiently, builds stakeholder trust by delivering within budget, and prevents project failure due to financial overextension. Controlling costs also optimizes resource allocation, avoiding waste and ensuring the project meets its objectives without compromising quality.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:

Accurate Cost Estimation: Base budgets on historical data, expert input, and estimation techniques like parametric modeling.
Scope Management: Define and enforce the project scope to prevent unplanned additions that increase costs.
Regular Budget Tracking: Monitor spending against the budget using tools like Earned Value Management (EVM) to catch deviations early.
Contingency Planning: Reserve a portion of the budget for unexpected challenges or changes.
Vendor Management: Negotiate clear contracts and oversee vendor performance to avoid hidden costs.
Resource Efficiency: Enhance team productivity with training and tools to minimize rework and delays.
Change Control Process: Establish a formal procedure to evaluate the cost impact of scope or schedule changes before approval.
These proactive measures ensure financial discipline, keeping the project aligns with its budget
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
